Hello
A small Game made in Java while learning and trying some new things 

#About the Game
The game is about controlling a player character to avoid enemy obstacles and survive for as long as possible while collecting points. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

#Board Class: This class extends JPanel and serves as the main game board where all the game elements are drawn and managed.

#Player and Enemy Classes: These classes represent the player character and enemy obstacles, respectively. They handle their positions, movements, and rendering on the game board.

#Game Loop: The game loop is implemented using a Timer object, which triggers periodic updates to the game state and rendering.

#Event Handling: Key events are handled to control the player character's movement. The player can move left or right using the arrow keys.

#Game Mechanics: Enemies move horizontally across the screen, and the player must avoid colliding with them. Colliding with an enemy results in the game ending. The player earns points by avoiding enemies for longer durations.

#Game State: The game can be paused and resumed using the Escape key. The game also tracks the remaining time and displays it on the screen.

#Overall, the game is simple yet challenging, requiring the player to navigate through obstacles while aiming for a high score.
