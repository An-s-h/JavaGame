Hello
A small Game made in Java while learning and trying some new things 

#About the Game
The game is about controlling a player character to kill/deafeat enemy obstacles and survive for as long as possible while collecting points. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

#Board Class: This class extends JPanel and serves as the main game board where all the game elements are drawn and managed.

#Player and Enemy Classes: These classes represent the player character and enemy obstacles(inspired from pokemon game used a Pokemon as enemy), respectively. They handle their positions, movements, and rendering on the game board.

#Game Loop: The game loop is implemented using a Timer object, which triggers periodic updates to the game state and rendering.

#Event Handling: Key events are handled to control the player character's movement. The player can move left or right using the arrow keys.

#Game Mechanics: Enemies move horizontally across the screen, and the player must defeats the enemy after  colliding with them.  The player earns points by defeating enemies for longer durations.

#Game State: The game can be paused and resumed using the Escape key. The game also tracks the remaining time and displays it on the screen.

#Overall, the game is simple yet challenging, requiring players to kill the enemies walking into them with sword out while aiming for high scores.
